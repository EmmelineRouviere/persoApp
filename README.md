"PersoApp" is my final project presented for the DWWM diploma in 2024/2025. This project is coded using PHP and JavaScript.

PersoApp is a food consumption tracking application (calories, proteins, carbohydrates, fats).

The application allows you to:

Calculate your BMI as well as your basic calorie needs

Enter foods that you consume regularly

Save your favorite meals

Add your meals day by day and calculate what you consume throughout the day

The project is still evolving, with new options coming soon!
